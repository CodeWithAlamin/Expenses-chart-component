This is a JavaScript project that displays a chart of daily expenses for a week. It fetches data from JSON files and dynamically updates the chart based on the data. In addition to the original dataset, two more sample data files have been added for demonstration purposes.

## What I learned

In building this project, I had the opportunity to learn and practice several key concepts in JavaScript. One of the most important concepts that I learned is working with JSON data. I was able to fetch data from external sources in the JSON format, parse the data into a format that is easily readable by JavaScript, and manipulate it to render it on the page.

I also learned how to use JavaScript to perform various calculations and manipulations on data. For example, I was able to find the maximum value in a data set, calculate percentages, and manipulate CSS styles based on the data.

Overall, building this project has greatly improved my understanding of JavaScript and has given me practical experience in building real-world applications using JavaScript.
